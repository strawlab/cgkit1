Changelog
=========

Changes from cgkit-1.1.0 to cgkit-1.2.0:

- ri.py: RiEnd() now always flushes the internal buffer
- ri.py: Bugfix: RiLightSource() didn't handle parameters passed inside a
  dictionary.
- cgtypes: Fixed a typo in quat.fromMat() that was generating a NameError in
  certain cases.
- Updated Pyrex which fixed a bug that could lead to a crash in Python 2.2
  when the garbage collection was running after vectors were unpacked.
  Python 2.3 was not affected by this bug.


Changes from cgkit-1.0.1 to cgkit-1.1.0:

- New module "cgkitinfo" that contains release information
- New module "slparams" that can extract RenderMan shader parameters 
  from shader source files.
- sltokenize: Bugfix: The filename that was passed to the tokeneater was
  containing a trailing apostroph.
- cgtypes: 
  * quat.fromAngleAxis() and the corresponding constructor now return a 
    unit quaternion.
  * New method quat.dot() that calculates the dot product
  * New methods quat.exp() and quat.log()
  * Quats now support the pow() function and ** operator
  * Two new functions: slerp() and squad() to do quaternion interpolation
    (Thanks to Max Rheiner)
- ri.py: The "version" call in the output stream can be suppressed by
  calling RiOption(RI_RIBOUTPUT, RI_VERSION, 0) directly after RiBegin()
  is called.
  (Thanks to Moritz Möller)
- ri.py: Support for RIB string handles. RiLightSource, RiAreaLightSource and
  RiObjectBegin support the parameter "__handleid" (RI_HANDLEID) which can be
  used to support a user defined string handle. RiIlluminate and 
  RiObjectInstance were modified accordingly so that they can take string 
  handles.
  (Thanks to Moritz Möller)
- ri.py: The version number in the RIB stream is now set to 3.03 instead
  of 3.2 as this version is not the version of the RI specification but the
  version of the Byte Stream protocol.
  (Thanks to Moritz Möller)
 

Changes from cgkit-1.0 to cgkit-1.0.1:

- The binary file for Python 2.2 was broken and the source zip contained
  a modified version of cgtypes.c (which was necessary for Python 2.3, 
  Pyrex 0.8.2 and VC6, but didn't work on Linux).

Changes from cgkit-1.0beta3 to cgkit-1.0:

- sl.py: Function ptlined() added.
- sl.py: Doc strings added.
- cgtypes: mat4: Added a new method orthographic() which is equivalent
         to the OpenGL command glOrtho().
- ri.py: The output of any initial RiArchvieRecord() calls will be placed
         *before* the version information. 
- ri.py: RiBegin() doesn't output any header information automatically 
         anymore, you have to do that manually. However, you can use the
         new utility function RiuDefaultHeader() to output a couple of 
         entries that can be determined automatically.
- ri.py: RiArchiveRecord() allows variables $DATE, $CREATOR, $USER in its
         format string.
- ri.py: Passing an empty string to RiBegin() has the same effect as
         passing RI_NULL (the stream will be written to stdout).
- ri.py: vec3 values can now be used as any 3-sequence.
- ri.py: vec3 values can now be used as colors (this wasn't possible because
         vec3 doesn't support slicing). 
- ri.py: The values of RI_KA, RI_KD, RI_KS and RI_KR are now upper-case.
- riutil: New function RiuDefaultHeader() which outputs a default header at
         the top of the RIB stream.
- riutil: RiuCoordSystem() takes a shader name as optional argument. 
- riutil: RiuGrid() takes the number of cells, the shader name and the color
          as optional arguments.
- sltokenize: Finished tokenizer. Now it actually does what the 
         documentation says.


Changes from cgkit-1.0beta2 to cgkit-1.0beta3:

- noise: Small change in the noise_template function so that older gcc 
  versions will also compile the module.
- Rewrite of cgtypes using Pyrex to speed up the types. The old pure 
  Python cgtypes are still available in pycgtypes.
  New in cgtypes:
  * Comparisons are using an epsilon environment. The threshold can be
    read and written using getEpsilon() and setEpsilon().
  * vec3/vec4: All comparison operators are supported now (== != < <= > >=)
  * vec4: The 4th component can be accessed either by name "w" or "t"
  * mat3/mat4: All methods taking vec3s as input also accept other
    3-sequences such as ordinary tuples or lists.
  * mat4: The index operator returns a vec4 when called with a single int.
  * mat4.perspective() was broken
  * New method mat4.setMat3()


Changes from cgkit-1.0beta1 to cgkit-1.0beta2:

- noise: On Linux the noise module couldn't be imported because the modules'
  init function couldn't be found. This was due to C++ name mangling. 
  For some reason, this was no problem under Windows.
- noise: Complete rewrite of the noise function. Now there are separate
  implementations for 2D,3D and 4D.
- noise: New functions: pnoise(), spnoise, cellnoise(), scellnoise(), 
  fBm(), turbulence(),
  vnoise(), vsnoise(), vpnoise(), vspnoise(), vcellnoise(), vscellnoise(), 
  vfBm(), vturbulence()
- sl.py: Added cellnoise and pnoise
- vec4.py: Method normalize() added
- ri.py: Bugfix in RiSolidBegin(): Apostrophes were missing in output
- riutil.py: Can be imported even if PIL is not installed. The exception
  will only be raised if a function is called that actually depends on PIL.
